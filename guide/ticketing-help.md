# Ticketing help

## How do I set the ticket log with the bot?

&#x20;Setting the ticket log is just very simple, here's an example of setting the ticket log below:

![and voila! we've got it!](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Discord will automatically sync its category permissions when new channels are created, with the channels if discord does not sync its perms you must go to the channel settings press "sync perms" to sync them manually.
{% endhint %}

## I have create a new ticket but everyone can read and send messages in them, so how can I fix this issue?

Yes Sadly, even though alot of people sees this common bug, this can be easily fixed by editing the category permissions. see below for details:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

* all you gotta do is just **disable** the permissions from "**everyone**" with the perms \
  "`view channel`" & "`send messages`" then it'll be fixed
