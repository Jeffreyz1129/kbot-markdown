# Guide

## let's go through all the things you can do with the kbots! :3

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT:**\
**- The kbots** must have administrator permissions on its role. KEEP IT! \
**-** No you can not change the bots prefix ( sorry ). \
\- Ticketing commands has a 1 minute cooldown to reduce rate limit issues, meaning ( slow ).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Getting Started**&#x20;

The first step is to make sure the bot is actually in your guild! You can invite any of these bots to guilds you have Manage Server permissions.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, **kbot** will ask for Administrator permissions, and it is highly recommended that you grant them. You may also customize the bots's permissions by editing the the bot's role. See [FAQ](https://kbot.gitbook.io/kbot-documentation/faq) for more details on customizing permissions.
